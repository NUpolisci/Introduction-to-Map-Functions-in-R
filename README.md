# Introduction-to-Map-Functions-in-R
Have you ever needed a function to be applied to multiple elements, such as datasets? Perhaps you want to run the same regression on different subsets of data. Or maybe you want to compare how different models perform against each other. Instead of copy and pasting your code repeatedly, `map()` functions can do this for you! In this workshop, we will review the structure and uses of lists. Then, we will discuss how map functions work with lists and how these functions can be used to streamline your workflow.
